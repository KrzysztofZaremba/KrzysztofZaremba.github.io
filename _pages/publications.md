 <summary> <b> <a href="https://krzysztofzaremba.github.io/files/KZ_JMP.pdf" target="_blank"> Effects of Intrahousehold Bargaining Power on Maternal and Neonatal Health</a>  </b> </summary>
 
 <br>
   <div align="justify">
This paper provides evidence that bargaining power in a relationship shapes pregnancy outcomes and health disparities in the US. A key driver of bargaining power is the availability of potential non incarcerated male partners in the local dating market, which I define at the race by cohort by county level. Because these sex ratios are endogenous, I use a novel instrument that leverages the randomness in sex at birth and the persistence of local demographics to isolate exogenous variation in the relative availability of men. Instrumental variables estimation shows that higher female bargaining power leads to better outcomes: fewer out-of-wedlock births, a lower rate of Chlamydia and Hypertension among mothers, and a lower share of infants with APGAR score below the normal level. These findings point to a significant contribution of the marriage market to racial disparities in pregnancy health, and a novel explanation for the large gap between Black and White mothers. Indeed, Black women face relatively poor prospects when looking for a partner compared to White women: while there are 102 White man per 100 White women, only 89 Black men are available per 100 Black women According to my estimates, Black women’s disadvantage accounts for 5-10% of the racial gap in maternal and neonatal health. Next, I use a decomposition technique to demonstrate that the racial difference in male availability is mostly policy driven, as incarceration accounts for 45% of the gap. I show with simulations that a counterfactual policy equalizing county-level incarceration rates for non-violent offenses between Black and White people would, if one considers the sole effect on female bargaining power, prevent 200-700 adverse pregnancy outcomes per year among Black mothers.

<summary> <b> <a href="https://krzysztofzaremba.github.io/files/Hotels_Opening_KZ.pdf" target="_blank"> Opening of hotels and ski facilities: Impact on mobility, spending, and Covid-19 outcomes</a> <em> (R&R at Health Economics) </em>  </b> </summary>

 <br>

 <div align="justify">
 
This paper investigates how reopening hotels and ski facilities in Poland impacted tourism spending, mobility, and COVID-19 outcomes. We used administrative data from a government program that subsidizes travel to show that the policy increased the consumption of tourism services in ski resorts. By leveraging geolocation data from Facebook, we showed that ski resorts experienced a significant influx of tourists, increasing the number of local users by up to 50%. Furthermore, we confirmed an increase in the probability of meetings between pairs of users from distanced locations and users from tourist and non-tourist areas. As the policy impacted travel and gatherings, we then analyzed its effect on the diffusion of COVID-19. We found that counties with ski facilities experienced more infections after the reopening. Moreover, counties strongly connected to the ski resorts during the reopening had more subsequent cases than weakly connected counties. Cost-benefit analysis shows that costs stemming from additional hospitalizations and deaths vastly outweighed the economic benefits of reopening, even in the ski resorts.

<summary> <b> <a href="https://krzysztofzaremba.github.io/files/KZ_Flu.pdf" target="_blank"> Contribution of school and commuting networks to spreading
influenza in Poland</a> </b> </summary>
 <br>


 <div align="justify">

Epidemics can have devastating health and economic consequences. This paper studies the diffusion of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) through social and economic networks. Using almost two decades of weekly, county-level infection and mortality data from Poland, it studies within and across-counties ILI transmission. Firstly, it evaluates the causal effect of school closures on viral transmission. The results show that closing schools for two weeks decreases the number of within county cases by 30-40%. The decline in infections extends to elderly and pre-school children. In addition, flu-related hospitalizations drop by 7.5%, and mortality related to respiratory diseases among the elderly drops by 3%. Secondly, the paper demonstrates the significant contribution of economic links to diffusion across counties. The disease follows the paths of workers commuting between home and workplace. Together with the structure of the labor mobility networks, these results highlight the central role of regional capitals in sustaining and spreading the virus.

<summary> <b>  Malpractice among New York Physicians </b> </summary>
<br>
  <div align="justify">
Being a victim of medical malpractice might have serious consequences for patient's health and should be relevant when choosing a physician.  This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict which physicians are likely to be disciplined for the malpractice by the
New York Medical Conduct Board. To build the predictions, we compiled a comprehensive datasets describing 100 000 physicians
licensed to practice in NY which include their characteristics, location, employment history, networks, education, and disciplinary actions. The goal is to assign each physician a risk score of committing professional misconduct. In the next phase of the project, we will use these scores to understand whether the risk of malpractice drives the choice of the provider and the prices of medical services offered.

<summary> <b>  Beware of Fake Friends: Spurious Links and Peer Effects in Networks</b> </summary>
<br>
 <div align="justify">
This paper discusses the robustness of the widely used IV method of estimating peer effects (from Bramoullé, [2009]) to spurious links. Spurious links are "false positive" connections which do not exist in reality, but are observed by a researcher. I show that this estimator is inconsistent when spurious links are present and it can indicate significant peer effects even if there are none. Next I suggest an unbiased test for the existence of peer effects and show its performance in simulations.

<summary> <b>  Spreading New Habits </b> </summary>
<br>
 <div align="justify">
Various behaviors of economic relevance, such as condom use or hand washing, are subject to habitual practice. This paper takes into account the habit formation to model the spread of new behaviors on networks. It augments traditional models of diffusion by a novel insight: the probability of abandoning a new behavior decreases with the time spent practicing it.  Three main results concerning interventions aiming to diffuse new behaviors stem from the augmented models. Firstly, repeated interventions are more successful at establishing new behaviors that require a long habit formation process. Secondly, there exists a trade-off between the minimum number of initial adopters needed to spread the behavior and intervention duration.  Thirdly, habit formation can introduce non-monotonicities in adoption patterns in time, identifying behaviors prone to habit.
