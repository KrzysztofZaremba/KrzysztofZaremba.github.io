## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Economics at Columbia University. 

My research is primarly in the fields of health and network economics. I am interested in economic aspects of infectious diseases. On the one hand, I investigate how economic behavior fuels the spread of infections. On the other hand, I look at the economic consequences of diseases. 

I am passionate about data analysis and data visualizations. See my app monitoring social distancing in Poland (in Polish): https://kzaremba.shinyapps.io/Dystansowanie/
