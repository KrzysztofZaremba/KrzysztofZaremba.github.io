I recently completed my Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University, and this fall, I will be joining the Business School at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México as an assistant professor. 

My main research fields are <b>health economics</b>,  <b>network economics</b>, and <b>family economics</b>.
