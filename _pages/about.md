<br>

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at Columbia University. 

My research is primarly in the fields of health, family, and network economics. I am interested in the economic aspects of infectious diseases. On the one hand, I investigate how economic behavior fuels the spread of infections. On the other hand, I look at the economic consequences of diseases. 

I am passionate about data analysis and data visualizations. Check out my app monitoring social distancing in Poland (in Polish): [https://kzaremba.shinyapps.io/Dystansowanie/](https://kzaremba.shinyapps.io/Dystansowanie/). You can also see an example of visualizations from my work in the animation below.
