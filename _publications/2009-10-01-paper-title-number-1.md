Sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise. They are particularly harmful among pregnant women as they can cause stillbirth, preterm birth, and infections in newborns. Since the fetus development is at risk, STD in utero can affect a child's long-term outcomes. In this project, I exploit quarterly state variation in the number of Gonorrhea and Chlamydia cases to investigate the disease's impact on adult outcomes. The presentation will show my empirical framework and preliminary results concerning birth and adult outcomes.
